This software allows the automated collection of large numbers of full text articles.

You can use the GUI to perform a PubMed search and then download the PDFs from the search results, or you can work with the API and just give it a set of starting point URLs or PubMed IDs.

3. Decompress the zip file using software appropriate for your operating system (i.e. Mac: Archive Utility, Linux: gunzip, Windows: WinZip or 7Zip)
