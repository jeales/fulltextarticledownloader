=== A quick walkthrough ===

This is a simple walkthrough that tells you how to actually use the software.
Firstly always try and run the software on a machine that as an IP address from your institution. Most publishers use IP-based user authentication and therefore you will always get better results when connected to your institutions network.  If you configure a proxy or VPN at the operating system level, then the software will use these details automatically, currently the software does not support it own configuration of proxy server access.

  # Run the software, see [http://code.google.com/p/fulltextarticledownloader/ here] if you don't know how to do this
  # Now lets build a PubMed query, firstly choose `"Author"` from the drop down list on the top left

  # Then as an example enter `"altschul sf"` in the text box next to the drop down
