= Logging =
Logging is controlled very, very simply.
There will be a file in the directory where you expanded the archive download.
It is called `fulltextarticledownloader.props` it contains on line which by default will be
{{{
logging=false
}}}

If you want to enable logging of the download agent, then change logging value to true like this.
{{{
logging=true
}}}
