= Requirements =
This software requires Java version 1.5 or above.
You can download it from [http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp here].
If you have a Mac (PowerPC or Intel), then Java will already be installed, and if you have applied all software updates, then you will have at least Java 1.5 installed and ready to go.

== Making sure Java is available on the command line ==
Sometime even if Java is installed, it will still not be available from the command line.
You can verify whether it is available by typing 
{{{
java -version
}}}
If Java is installed and available then you should get something like this
{{{
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_20-b02-315)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_20-141, mixed mode, sharing)
}}}
